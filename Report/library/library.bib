abstract = {Recent developments in humanoid robotics have made possible a vision of robots in everyday use in the home and workplace. However, little is known about how we should design social interactions with humanoid robots. We explored how cooperation versus competition in a game shaped people's perceptions of ASIMO. We found that in the co-operative interaction, people found the robot more sociable and more intellectual than in the competitive interaction while people felt more positive and were more involved in the task in the competitive condition than in the co-operative condition. Our poster presents these findings with the supporting theoretical background.},

@article{Ruckert2012,
abstract = {BIOLOGICAL MOVEMENT GENERATION COMBINES THREE INTERESTING ASPECTS: its modular organization in movement primitives (MPs), its characteristics of stochastic optimality under perturbations, and its efficiency in terms of learning. A common approach to motor skill learning is to endow the primitives with dynamical systems. Here, the parameters of the primitive indirectly define the shape of a reference trajectory. We propose an alternative MP representation based on probabilistic inference in learned graphical models with new and interesting properties that complies with salient features of biological movement control. Instead of endowing the primitives with dynamical systems, we propose to endow MPs with an intrinsic probabilistic planning system, integrating the power of stochastic optimal control (SOC) methods within a MP. The parameterization of the primitive is a graphical model that represents the dynamics and intrinsic cost function such that inference in this graphical model yields the control policy. We parameterize the intrinsic cost function using task-relevant features, such as the importance of passing through certain via-points. The system dynamics as well as intrinsic cost function parameters are learned in a reinforcement learning (RL) setting. We evaluate our approach on a complex 4-link balancing task. Our experiments show that our movement representation facilitates learning significantly and leads to better generalization to new task settings without re-learning.},

abstract = {Despite the recent achievements in stable dynamic walking for many humanoid robots, relatively little navigation autonomy has been achieved. In particular, the ability to autonomously select foot placement positions to avoid obstacles while walking is an important step towards improved navigation autonomy for humanoids. We present a footstep planner for the Honda ASIMO humanoid robot that plans a sequence of footstep positions to navigate toward a goal location while avoiding obstacles. The possible future foot placement positions are dependent on the current state of the robot. Using a finite set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal sequences of footstep locations up to a time-limited planning horizon. We present experimental results demonstrating the robot navigating through both static and dynamic known environments that include obstacles moving on predictable trajectories.},

@article{Or2010,
abstract = {Biped humanoid robots have gained much popularity in recent years. These robots are mainly controlled by two major control methods, the biologically-inspired approach based on Central Pattern Generator (CPG) and the engineering-oriented approach based on Zero Moment Point (ZMP). Given that flexibility in the body torso is required in some human activities, we believe that it is beneficial for the next generation of humanoid robots to have a flexible spine as humans do. In order to cope with the increased complexity in controlling this type of robot, a new kind of control system is necessary. Currently, there is no controller that allows a flexible spine humanoid robot to maintain stability in real-time while walking with dynamic spine motions. This paper presents a new hybrid CPG-ZMP control system for the walking of a realistically simulated flexible spine humanoid robot. Experimental results showed that using our control method, the robot is able to adapt its spine motions in real-time to allow stable walking. Our control system could be used for the control of the next generation humanoid robots.},

abstract = {The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, recognize faces or spoken speech, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. It discusses many methods based in different fields, including statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining, in order to present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and solutions. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have completed courses in computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.<br <br After an introduction that defines machine learning and gives examples of machine learning applications, the book covers supervised learning, Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods, dimensionality reduction, clustering, nonparametric methods, decision trees, linear discrimination, multilayer perceptrons, local models, hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification algorithms, combining multiple learners, and reinforcement learning.},

@article{Schaal2010,
abstract = {With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher efficiency and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario. We believe that Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.},

abstract = {Models are among the most essential tools in robotics, such as kinematics and dynamics models of the robot's own body and controllable external objects. It is widely believed that intelligent mammals also rely on internal models in order to generate their actions. However, while classical robotics relies on manually generated models that are based on human insights into physics, future autonomous, cognitive robots need to be able to automatically generate models that are based on information which is extracted from the data streams accessible to the robot. In this paper, we survey the progress in model learning with a strong focus on robot control on a kinematic as well as dynamical level. Here, a model describes essential information about the behavior of the environment and the influence of an agent on this environment. In the context of model-based learning control, we view the model from three different perspectives. First, we need to study the different possible model learning architectures for robotics. Second, we discuss what kind of problems these architecture and the domain of robotics imply for the applicable learning methods. From this discussion, we deduce future directions of real-time learning algorithms. Third, we show where these scenarios have been used successfully in several case studies.},

In this paper we present our experiences and results while building an autonomous robotic assistant using the PR2<sup>1</sup> platform and ROS2. The system integrates several new components that are built on top of the PR2's current capabilities. Perception components include dynamic obstacle identification, mechanisms for identifying the refrigerator, types of drinks, and human faces. Planning components include navigation, arm motion planning with goal and path constraints, and grasping modules. One of the main contributions of this paper is a new task-level executive system, SMACH, based on hierarchical concurrent state machines, which controls the overall behavior of the system. We provide in-depth discussions on the solutions that we found in accomplishing our goal, and the implementation strategies that let us achieve them.},

@article{Diankov2010,
abstract = {Society is becoming more automated with robots beginning to perform most tasks in facto- ries and starting to help out in home and office environments. One of the most important functions of robots is the ability to manipulate objects in their environment. Because the space of possible robot designs, sensor modalities, and target tasks is huge, researchers end up having to manually create many models, databases, and programs for their specific task, an effort that is repeated whenever the task changes. Given a specification for a robot and a task, the presented framework automatically constructs the necessary databases and pro- grams required for the robot to reliably execute manipulation tasks. It includes contributions in three major components that are critical for manipulation tasks. The first is a geometric-based planning system that analyzes all necessary modalities of manipulation planning and offers efficient algorithms to formulate and solve them. This allows identification of the necessary information needed from the task and robot specifica- tions. Using this set of analyses, we build a planning knowledge-base that allows informative geometric reasoning about the structure of the scene and the robots goals. We show how to efficiently generate and query the information for planners. The second is a set of efficient algorithms considering the visibility of objects in cameras when choosing manipulation goals. We show results with several robot platforms using grippers cameras to boost accuracy of the detected objects and to reliably complete the tasks. Furthermore, we use the presented planning and visibility infrastructure to develop a completely automated extrinsic camera calibration method and a method for detecting insufficient calibration data. The third is a vision-centric database that can analyze a rigid objects surface for stable and discriminable features to be used in pose extraction programs. Furthermore, we show work towards a new voting-based object pose extraction algorithm that does not rely on 2D/3D feature correspondences and thus reduces the early-commitment problem plaguing the generality of traditional vision-based pose extraction algorithms. In order to reinforce our theoric contributions with a solid implementation basis, we discuss the open-source planning environment OpenRAVE, which began and evolved as a result of the work done in this thesis. We present an analysis of its architecture and provide insight for successful robotics software environments.},

abstract = {Prioritization of flows in a home network based on traffic classification is still no guarantee that enough bandwidth will be available between a server and a client. Besides, such QoS technologies need to be supported by every device in the end-to-end path to be effective, which is relatively expensive for the owners of home networks. In any small-scale IP network (best-effort or QoS-enabled) it is therefore preferable to diagnose the network in real time, before admitting a new flow. In this paper we demonstrate a new method to probe the available bandwidth between a server and a client in an IP-based home network. The tool works with existing end-user devices, is non-intrusive, has a short measurement time, does not require pre-knowledge of the link layer network topology, and is accurate enough to make decisions about the admission of high-throughput high-quality streams such as for IPTV services.},

abstract = {A number of supervised learning methods have been introduced in the last decade. Unfortunately, the last comprehensive empirical evaluation of supervised learning was the Statlog Project in the early 90's. We present a large-scale empirical comparison between ten supervised learning methods: SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps. We also examine the effect that calibrating the models via Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their performance. An important aspect of our study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods.},

Recent work has primarily focused on the development of distinct point features. While these features achieve impressive recognition results, point features fail to capture the shape and appearance of an object with less or even without texture. This paper proposes a novel method for the rapid and dense computation of 2D and 3D image cues from RGB-D data to target the recognition of objects without rich texture and a global histogram-based descriptor for the distinct description of object models.},

abstract = {BIOLOGICAL MOVEMENT GENERATION COMBINES THREE INTERESTING ASPECTS: its modular organization in movement primitives (MPs), its characteristics of stochastic optimality under perturbations, and its efficiency in terms of learning. A common approach to motor skill learning is to endow the primitives with dynamical systems. Here, the parameters of the primitive indirectly define the shape of a reference trajectory. We propose an alternative MP representation based on probabilistic inference in learned graphical models with new and interesting properties that complies with salient features of biological movement control. Instead of endowing the primitives with dynamical systems, we propose to endow MPs with an intrinsic probabilistic planning system, integrating the power of stochastic optimal control (SOC) methods within a MP. The parameterization of the primitive is a graphical model that represents the dynamics and intrinsic cost function such that inference in this graphical model yields the control policy. We parameterize the intrinsic cost function using task-relevant features, such as the importance of passing through certain via-points. The system dynamics as well as intrinsic cost function parameters are learned in a reinforcement learning (RL) setting. We evaluate our approach on a complex 4-link balancing task. Our experiments show that our movement representation facilitates learning significantly and leads to better generalization to new task settings without re-learning.},

The applicability of optimization methods is tied up to the dimensionality of the problem, but since the distance between data points is a key factor, clustering techniques to partition the data space can be applied, converting the large initial problem into several simpler ILA problems that can be solved separately. This paper presents a novel method that combines clustering and heuristic methods to solve an ILA problem, which reduces the elapsed time keeping the quality of the solution found compared with other heuristics methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Less than half the Earth's landmass is accessible to existing wheeled and tracked vehicles. But people and animals using their legs can go almost anywhere on Earth. Our mission at Boston Dynamics is to develop a new breed of rough-terrain robots that capture the mobility, autonomy and speed of living creatures. Such robots will travel in outdoor terrain that is too steep, rutted, rocky, wet, muddy, and snowy for conventional vehicles. They will also travel in cities and in our homes, doing chores and providing care, where steps, stairways and household clutter limit the utility of wheeled vehicles. Robots meeting these goals will have terrain sensors, sophisticated computing and power systems, advanced actuators and dynamic controls. I will give a status report on BigDog, an example of such rough-terrain robots. It is a 100 kg quadruped robot that balances actively as it operates on a variety of outdoor terrains, carries a 65 kg load, runs travels at up to 11 kph.},

abstract = { The growing diversity and complexity of existing robotic devices like humanoids, animal-like robots or wheeled robots, lead to the development of several incompatible software interfaces to control these robots. We believe that there is a need for a standard which could be universal, powerful and easy to use. The open source project URBI, a universal robotic body interface, aims at providing the ground for such a standard. It is based on a client/server architecture where the server is running on the robot and accessed by the client, on the robot or remotely via TCP/IP. The URBI language is a scripted language used by the client and capable of controlling the joints of the robot or access its sensors, camera, speakers or any accessible part of the machine. We present in this article an introduction to URBI and we describe how URBI differs from currently existing solutions. As an example making use of URBI-specific features, we present a simple perturbative approach to walk pattern generation, with URBI running on a ERS7 Aibo robot.},

abstract = {A salient feature of human motor skill learning is the ability to exploit similarities across related tasks. In biological motor control, it has been hypothesized that muscle synergies, coherent activations of groups of muscles, allow for exploiting shared knowledge. Recent studies have shown that a rich set of complex motor skills can be generated by a combination of a small number of muscle synergies. In robotics, dynamic movement primitives are commonly used for motor skill learning. This machine learning approach implements a stable attractor system that facilitates learning and it can be used in high-dimensional continuous spaces. However, it does not allow for reusing shared knowledge, i.e., for each task an individual set of parameters has to be learned. We propose a novel movement primitive representation that employs parametrized basis functions, which combines the benefits of muscle synergies and dynamic movement primitives. For each task a superposition of synergies modulates a stable attractor system. This approach leads to a compact representation of multiple motor skills and at the same time enables efficient learning in high-dimensional continuous systems. The movement representation supports discrete and rhythmic movements and in particular includes the dynamic movement primitive approach as a special case. We demonstrate the feasibility of the movement representation in three multi-task learning simulated scenarios. First, the characteristics of the proposed representation are illustrated in a point-mass task. Second, in complex humanoid walking experiments, multiple walking patterns with different step heights are learned robustly and efficiently. Finally, in a multi-directional reaching task simulated with a musculoskeletal model of the human arm, we show how the proposed movement primitives can be used to learn appropriate muscle excitation patterns and to generalize effectively to new reaching skills.},
